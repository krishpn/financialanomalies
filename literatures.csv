SM: The natural logarithm of MV
BM_Raw: The book-to-market ratio defined as BV/MV, where the book value (BV) is common equity plus deferred taxes (in million dollars)
BM_Trim: on equity plus deferred taxes (in million dollars). BMJTrim: The Winsorized book-to-market ratio, where BMJlaw values greater than the 99.5 percentile value or less than the 0.5 percentile value in a month are set equal to the 99.5 and 0.5 percentile values, respectively
BTM: nth are set equal to the 99.5 and 0.5 percentile values, respectively. BTM: The natural logarithm of BM. Trim. Following Fama and French (1992), we fill monthly BMJlaw (hence BM.Trim and BTM) values for July of year t to June of year t + 1 with the value computed using the accounting data at the end of year t - 1, assuming a lag of six months before the annual accounting numbers are known to investors
MOM1: The compounded holding period return of a stock over th most recent three months
M0M2: The compounded holding-period return over the next recent three months (from month t - 4 to month t - 6). 
M0M3: The compounded holding-period return over the three months from month t - 1 to month t - 9. 
M0M4: The compounded holding-period return over the three months from month t - 9 to month t - 12. For each of the above four momentum variables to exist, a stock should have all three consecutive monthly returns over the corresponding three-month period
Amihud: The illiquidity measure of Amihud (2002). We estimate this measure each month as the average of DDVOL, where r is the daily stock return and DDVOL is the daily dollar volume in thousand
RolLGibbs: The market risk-adjusted effective bid-ask spread of Roll (1984), estimated at an annual frequency using the Gibbs sampler. This measure was obtained from Joel Hasbrouck's website
DVOL: The average of daily dollar volume (in thousand dollars) within each month for each stock.
TURN: The average of daily share turnover values within each month for each stock.",,,,,
