Fama and MacBeth (1973) show two-parameter regression model estimates
average risk-return relationships based on efficient market porfolio
(\(m\)), that is, the market prices fully reflect the available
information. The asset are constructed based on Equation
\ref{Equation:BlackScholes1972} for an asset (\(i\)) proposed by @Black
(1972).

\begin{align}
    &x_{im}  \equiv \frac{\text{total market value of all units of assets} \ i}{\text{total market value of all assets}} \\
    &\text{where asset} (i) \text{in the portfolio} (m) \nonumber 
\end{align}
\label{Equation:BlackScholes1972}

Excepted return of a security (\(i\)) is \(E(\tilde{R_0})\), the
expected return on a security that is riskless in the portfolio \(m\),
plus a risk premium that is \(\beta_i\) times the difference between
expected return of the portfolio (\(E(\tilde{R_m})\) ) and riskless
portfolio (\(E(\tilde{R_0})\)). is calculated by Equation
\ref{Equation:ExpectedReturnFama1953}, \(\beta_i\) is the risk of the
asset \(i\) of the portfolio \(m\), measured relative to
\(\sigma^{2}(\tilde{R}_m)\)

\begin{align}
    &E(\tilde{R_i}) = \left[E(\tilde{R_m}) -S_m \sum\tilde{R_m}  \right] + S_m \sigma (\tilde{R_m}) \beta_i, \nonumber \\
    &\text{where}, \nonumber \\ 
    &\beta_i \equiv \frac{cov(\tilde{R_i}, \tilde{R_m})}{\sigma^2(\tilde{R_m})} = \frac{\sigma_{j=1}^{N} x_{jm}\sigma_{ij}}{\sigma^2 (\tilde{R_m})}=\frac{cov(\tilde{R_i},\tilde{R_m})/\sigma(\tilde{R_m})}{\sigma (\tilde{R_m})} \nonumber \\
    &S_m=\frac{E(\tilde{R_m})-E(\tilde{R_0})}{\sigma (\tilde{R_m})}  \nonumber\\
    \text{hence} \nonumber \\
    &E(\tilde{R_i}) = E(\tilde{R_0}) + \left[ E(\tilde{R_m}) - E(\tilde{R_0}) \right] \beta_i
\end{align}
\label{Equation:ExpectedReturnFama1953}

For each period of \(t\), the cross sectional regression is given by

\begin{align}
    & R_{pt} = \tilde{\gamma}_{0t} + \tilde{\gamma}_{1t} \tilde{\beta}_{p,t-1}+\tilde{\gamma}_{2t} \tilde{\beta}_{p,t-1}^{2} + \tilde{\gamma}_{3t} \bar{s}_{p, t-1} \tilde{\epsilon}_{i}+\tilde{\eta}_{pt}, \\
    &p=1,2,...t \nonumber
\end{align}
\label{Equation:ExpectedReturnFama1953EquationTen}

Equation \ref{Equation:ExpectedReturnFama1953EquationTen} the indepenent
variable \(\tilde{\beta}_{p,t-1}\) is the average of the
\(\tilde{\beta}_i\) for securities in portfolio \(p\),
\(\tilde{\beta}_{p,t-1}^2\) is the average of the squared values of
these \(\tilde{\beta}_i\), \(\bar{s}_{p, t-1} \tilde{\epsilon}_{i}\) is
the average of \(s\tilde{\epsilon}_i\) for portfolio \(p_i\)

Gupta and Ofer (1975) examines investors growth expectations reflected
in the stock prices. A change in the expectation is reflected in the
price movement. The study defines the earnings price ratio is a function
of risk characteristics of the security and the expected growth in the
earnings in Equation \ref{Equation:OferEquation1975EquationOne}. The
risk component are measured by: - the beta coefficient - the firm asset
size (natural logarithm of total asset) - dividend payout ratio -
leverage ratio of liabilties and preferred stocks to the common stock
outstanding - earnings variablity (standard deviation of earnings to
price ratio calcuated over period of seven years)

\begin{align}
    &EP = f(RS, EG) \\
    &\text{where:} \nonumber \\
    & EP = \text{earnings price ratio- }, \nonumber \\
    & RS = \text{risk characteristics of the security} \nonumber \\
    & EG =\text{the expected growth rate in the earnings} \nonumber \\
\end{align}
\label{Equation:OferEquation1975EquationOne}

\begin{align}
    & \Delta P_{i}^{t} = \frac{P_{it}-P_{it-1}}{P_{it-1}} \times 100 \\
    & \text{where:} \nonumber \\ 
    & \Delta P_{i}^{t} \text{is the percent change of the security } i \text{during the period } t-1 \text{to} t \nonumber \\
    & \text{The average yearly percentage of the prices change for portfolio } j (\Delta P_j) \text{ is given by} \nonumber \\
    & \Delta P_{j} =\frac{\sum_{t=1}^{14} \frac{\sum_{r_t=10j-9}^{10j} \Delta P_{rt}^{t}}{14} }{14}, r_{t}=1,\cdots,190 \nonumber\\
    & \text{where:} \nonumber \\
    & r_{t} = \text{the relative ranking of a security at time } t \text{ according to its prediction error at that year}. \\
    & \Delta P_{t}^{rt} = \text{percentage price change during the period } t-1 \text{ to } t \text{ for a security that has the rank of } r_t \text{ at time } t
\end{align}
\label{Equation:OferEquation1975}

Basu (1977): to determine empirically whether the investment performance
of the common stocks is related to the \(P/E\) ratios. \(P/E\) is the
ratio of market value of the common stock (market price times the number
of shares outstanding) as of December 31 to reporting annual earnings
(before extraordinary items) available for common stockholders.
According to the paper, due the exaggerated investor expectations,
\(P/E\) ratio may be the indicator of future investment peroformance.
The paper shows that \(P/E\) is not fully reflected in security prices
in as rapid a manner as postulated by the semi-strong form of the
efficient market hypothesis. Instead, it seems that disequilibrium
persisted in the capital market during the period studied. The results
suggests that market efficiency does not exist due to lags and frictions
in the price adjustmnet process.

Litzenberger and Ramaswamy (1979):

\begin{align}
    & \tilde{R} -r_{ft} = \gamma_{0} +  \gamma_{1} \beta_{it} +  \gamma_{2} (d_{it}-r_{ft}) + \tilde{\epsilon}_{it}, i=1,2,\cdots,N, t=1,2,\cdots,T \\
    &\text{where :} \nonumber \\
    & \tilde{R}_{it} \text{Return of the security } i \text{ in period } t, \beta_{it} \text{ and } d_{it} \text{ are the systemic risk and the dividend yield of security  } i \text{ in period } t. \nonumber \\
    & \tilde{\epsilon}_{it}, a disturbance term is \tilde{R} - E(\tilde{R}_{it}), the deviation of the realized return from the expected value.\nonumber \\
    & \text{coeffiecients } \gamma_0, \gamma_1, \gamma_2
\end{align}
\label{Equation:Litzenberger1979Eqn23}

Banz (1981): studies ``size effect'' by using market indices - Market
Index, CRSP value weighted, CRSP equal weighted indexes, US Bond Index,
Corporate Bond Index to estimate the relationship between the return and
market value based on Equation \ref{Equation:banz1981Equation3}. The
study suggests the CAPM is misspecified.

\begin{align}
    &R_{it} = \gamma_{0t}+\gamma_{1t}\beta_{1t}+\gamma_{2t} \left[ (\phi_{1t}-\phi_{mt}) \right] + \epsilon_{it}, i=1,\cdots,N \\
    &\text{where:} \nonumber \\
    & R_i = \text{return on security } i \nonumber \\
    & \gamma_0= \text{return on a zero-beta portfolio}\nonumber \\
    & \gamma_1= \text{return on market risk premium}\nonumber \\
    & \phi_i= \text{market value security } i\nonumber \\
    & \phi_m= \text{average market value } \nonumber \\
    & \gamma_2 \text{constant measuring the contribution of} \phi_i \text{to the expected return of a security} \nonumber \\
\end{align}
\label{Equation:banz1981Equation3}

Figlewski (1981) estimates ``The test methodology we will use is a
familiar one. We construct ten port? folios to which stocks are assigned
according to their average short interest during the previous six
months, and calculate the portfolio a's or excess returns.''

Basu (1983): The empirical findings reported in this paper indicate
that, at least during the 1963-80 time period, the returns on the common
stock of NYSE firms appear to have been related to earnings' yield and
firm size.

De Bondt and Thaler (1985): ``This study of market efficiency
investigates whether such behavior affects stock prices. The empirical
evidence, based on CRSP monthly return data, is consistent with the
overreaction hypothesis. Substantial weak form market inefficiencies are
discovered. The results also shed new light on the January returns
earned by prior''winners'' and ``losers.'' Portfolios of losers
experience exceptionally large January returns as late as five years
after portfolio formation. To repeat, our goal is to test whether the
overreaction hypothesis is predictive. Specifically, two hypotheses are
suggested: (1) Extreme movements in stock prices will be followed by
subsequent price movements in the opposite direction. (2) The more
extreme the initial price movement, the greater will be the subsequent
adjustment. Both hypotheses imply a violation of weak-form market
efficiency.''

Bhandari (1988): ``The expected returns on common stocks are positively
related to the debt/equity ratio (DER), controlling for the beta and
firm size, both including and excluding January. This relationship is
not sensitive to variations in the market proxy, estimation technique,
etc. The evidence suggests that the''premium'' associated with the
debt/equity ratio is not likely to be just some kind of ``risk
premium''''

\begin{align}
    & E(\tilde{r}_i) = E(\tilde{\gamma}_0) + E(\tilde{\gamma}_1){LTEQ}_i+E(\tilde{\gamma}_2){BETA}_i+E(\tilde{\gamma}_3)+{DER}_i, i=1,\cdots, N \\
    &\text{where: } \nonumber \\
    &\text{Natural Logarithm of Total Common Equity (LETQ) where total common equity} \nonumber \\ &\text{ is the number of shares outstanding times (month-end) price per share }\nonumber \\
    &\text{Debt to Equity Ratio (DER)}\nonumber = \frac{\text{book value of total assets} -\text{book value of common equity}}{\text{market value of common equity}}\\
    &\text{BETA, the risk measure}\nonumber
\end{align}
\label{Equation:bhandari1988debtEquation1}

Amihud and Mendelson (1986): ``llliquidity can be measured by the cost
of immediate execution. An investor willing to transact faces a
tradeoff: He may either wait to transact at a favorable price or insist
on immediate execution at the current bid or ask price. The quoted ask
(offer) price includes a premium for immediate buying, and the bid price
similarly reflects a concession required for immediate sale. Thus. a
natural measure of illiquidity is the spread between the bid and ask
prices, which is the sum of the buying premium and the selling
concession.' Indeed. the relative spread on stocks has been found to be
negatively correlated with liquidity characteristics such as the trading
volume, the number of shareholders. the number of market makers trading
the stock and the stock price continuity.''

Amihud and Mendelson (1989):

The percentage bid-ask spread (= dollar spread divided by the stock
price)

\begin{align}
    &R_{pm} = \gamma_{0}+\gamma_{1}\beta_{pn}+\gamma_{2}\sigma_{pn}+\gamma_{3}SZ_{pn}+\gamma_{4}S_{pn}+\sum_{n=1}^{19}d_n{DY}_n+\epsilon_{pn}
    &\text{where: } \nonumber \\
    & p \text{ is the portolio} \nonumber \\
    & \beta_{pn} \text{ portfolio beta} \nonumber \\
    & \sigma_{pn} \text{ residual standard deviation} \nonumber \\
    & S_{pn} \text{ the portfolio average spread} \nonumber \\
    & {SZ}_{pn} \text{ average market value of the portfolio} \nonumber \\
\end{align}
\label{Equation:amihud1989effectsEquation2}

Ou and Penman (1989): ``Implements multivariate LOGIT analysis in
financial statements. Fundamental analysis extracts value measures from
financial statements and compares them to prices to identify mispriced
stocks. The evidence here suggests that financial statements capture
fundamentals that are not reflected in prices.''

Jegadeesh (1990): ``This paper documents strong evidence of predictable
behavior of security returns. The results here show that the monthly
returns on individual stocks exhibit. significantly negative first-order
serial correlation and significantly positive higher-order serial
correlation. The pattern of serial correlation exhibits seasonality,
with the pattern in January significantly different from that in the
other months.''

Jegadeesh and Titman (1993):

Loughran and Ritter (1995) : ``Investing in firms issuing stock is
hazardous to your wealth. Firms issuing stock during 1970 to 1990,
whether an IPO or an SEO, have been poor long-run investments for
investors. s. The average annual return during the five years after
issuing is only 5 percent for firms conducting IPOs, and only 7 percent
for firms conducting SEOs. Investing an equal amount at the same time in
a nonissuing firm with approximately the same market capitalization, and
holding it for an identical period, would have produced an average
compound return of 12 percent per year for IPOs and 15 percent for SEOs.
The magnitude of the underperformance is large: it implies that 44
percent more money would need to be invested in the issuers than in the
nonissuers to be left with the same wealth five years later.''

Michaely, Thaler, and Womack (1995): ``Market reaction to the dividend
initiations.''

La Porta (1996): '' Contrarian strategies that use analysts'
expectations to form portfolios yield high returns. Specifically, when
stocks are sorted by the expected growth rate in earnings, low E\{g\}
stocks beat high E\{g\} stocks by twenty percentage points.. Finally,
event study evidence suggests that the market was overly pessimistic
about the earnings of the low E\{g\} portfolio and excessively
optimistic about the earnings of the high E\{g\} portfolio''

Lev and Sougiannis (1996): ``To address these concerns, we estimate the
R\&D capital of a large sample of public companies and find these
estimates to be statistically reliable and economically meaningful. We
then adjust the reported earnings and book values of sample firms for
the R\&D capitalization and find that such adjustments are
value-relevant to investors.''

Sloan (1996): ``This paper investigates whether stock prices reflect
information about future earnings contained in the accrual and cash flow
components of current earnings. The persistence of earnings performance
is shown to depend on the relative magnitudes of the cash and accrual
components of earnings. However, stock prices act as if investors fail
to identify correctly the different properties of these two components
of earnings''

Womack (1996): '' An analysis of new buy and sell recommendations of
stocks by security analysts at major U.S. brokerage firms shows
significant, systematic discrepancies between prerecommendation prices
and eventual values. The initial return at the time of the
recommendations is large, even though few recommendations coincide with
new public news or provide previously unavailable facts. However, these
initial price reactions are incomplete. For buy recommendations, the
mean postevent drift is modest (+2.4\%) and short-lived, but for sell
recommendations, the drift is larger (-9.1\%) and extends for six
months. Analysts appear to have market timing and stock picking
abilities''

Brennan, Chordia, and Subrahmanyam (1998): ``We examine the relation
between stock returns, measures of risk, and several non-risk security
characteristics, including the book-to-market ratio, firm size, the
stock price, the dividend yield, and lagged returns. Our primary
objective is to determine whether non-risk characteristics have marginal
explanatory power relative to the arbitrage pricing theory benchmark,
with factors determined using, in turn, the Connor and Korajczyk (CK;
1988) and the Fama and French (FF; 1993b) approaches.
Fama---MacBeth-type regressions using risk adjusted returns provide
evidence of return momentum, size, and book-to-market effects, together
with a significant and negative relation between returns and trading
volume, even after accounting for the CK factors. When the analysis is
repeated using the FF factors, we find that the size and book-to-market
effects are attenuated, while the momentum and trading volume effects
persist. In addition, Nasdaq stocks show significant underperformance
after adjusting for risk using either method''

Brennan, Chordia, and Subrahmanyam (1998): Regardless of the method used
to risk-adjust returns, we find a strong negative relation between
average returns and trading volume, which is consistent with a liquidity
premium in asset prices. In addition, the size and book-to-market ratio
effects are strong in the CK method of risk-adjustment, while the FF
factors attenuate both the magnitude and significance of these effects.

Dichev (1998): '' Several studies suggest that a firm distress risk
factor could be behind the size and the book-to-market effects. A
natural proxy for firm distress is bankruptcy risk. If bankruptcy risk
is systematic, one would expect a positive association between
bankruptcy risk and subsequent realized returns. However, resullts
demonstrate that bankruptcy risk is not rewarded by higher returns.
Thus, a distress factor is unlikely to account for the size and
book-to-market effects. Surprisingly, firms with high bankruptcy risk
earn lower than average returns since 1980. A risk-based explanation
cannot fully explain the anomalous evidence.''

Datar, Naik, and Radcliffe (1998): ``In this paper, we provide an
alternative test of A\&M's model using the turnover rate as a proxy for
liquidity and found strong support for A\&M's model. In particular, we
find that the stock returns are strongly negatively related to their
turnover rates confirming the notion that illiquid stocks provide higher
average returns.'' - Monthly Returns - turnover rate of every stock =
monthly trading volume (the average number of shares traded during the
previous three months, i.e., during months t- 3, t-2 and t-1) and divide
it by the number of shares outstanding of that firm - turnover rate of
every stock - book-to-market ratio, - firm size - firm beta

Moskowitz and Grinblatt (1999): '' This paper documents a strong and
prevalent momentum effect in ind ponents of stock returns which accounts
for much of the individual sto tum anomaly. Specifically, momentum
investment strategies, which buy p stocks and sell past losing stocks,
are significantly less profitable once for industry momentum. By
contrast, industry momentum investmen which buy stocks from past winning
industries and sell stocks from p industries, appear highly profitable,
even after controlling for size, book equity, individual stock momentum,
the cross-sectional dispersion in m and potential microstructur''

Lee and Swaminathan (2000): ``This study shows that past trading volume
provides an important link between''momentum'' and ``value'' strategies.
Specifically, we find that firms with high (low) past turnover ratios
exhibit many glamour (value) characteristics, earn lower (higher) future
returns, and have consistently more negative (positive) earnings
surprises over the next eight quarters. Past trading volume also
predicts both the magnitude and persistence of price momentum.
Specifically, price momentum effects reverse over the next five years,
and high (low) volume winners (losers) experience faster reversals.
Collectively, our findings show that past volume helps to reconcile
intermediate-horizon ``underreaction'' and long-horizon ``overreaction''
effects''

Asness, Porter, and Stevens (2000): ``Better proxies for the information
about future returns contained in firm characteristics such as size,
book-to-market equity, cash flow-to-price, percent change in employees,
and various past return measures are obtained by breaking these
explanatory variables into two industry-related components.''

Piotroski (2000):

Chordia, Subrahmanyam, and Anshuman (2001): ``A body of literature
starting with Amihud and Mendelson (1986) has found that investors
demand a premium for less liquid stocks, so that expected returns.
should be negatively related to the level of liquidity. In this paper,
we document negative and signi''cant cross-sectional relationship
between average stock returns and the level as well as the second moment
of measures of trading activity such as dollar volume and share
turnover. Given the evidence that the level of liquidity affects asset
returns, a reasonable hypothesis is that the second moment of liquidity
should be positively related to asset returns, provided agents care
about the risk associated with fluctuations in liquidity. Motivated by
this observation, we analyze the relation between expected equity
returns and the level as well as the volatility of trading activity, a
proxy for liquidity. We document a result contrary to our initial
hypothesis, namely, a negative and surprisingly strong cross-sectional
relationship between stock returns and the variability of dollar trading
volume and share turnover, after controlling for size, book-to-market
ratio, momentum, and the level of dollar volume or share turnover. This
e!ect survives a number of robustness checks, and is statistically and
economically signi''cant. Our analysis demonstrates the importance of
trading activity-related variables in the crosssection of expected stock
returns.''

Lamont, Polk, and Saaá-Requejo (2001): ``We test whether the impact of
financial constraints on firm value is observable in stock returns. We
form portfolios of firms based on observable characteristics related to
financial constraints and test for common variation in stock returns.
Financially constrained firms' stock returns move together over time,
suggesting that constrained firms are subject to common shocks.
Constrained firms have low average stock returns in our 1968--1997
sample of growing manufacturing firms. We find no evidence that the
relative performance of constrained firms reflects monetary policy,
credit conditions, or business cycles. We construct various zero-cost
portfolios that are long financially constrained firms and short less
constrained firms and find three results. First, these portfolios
capture common variation in stock returns not captured by other sources
of return comovements. Thus we conclude that there is a financial
constraints factor, an identifiable independent common source of
economic shocks to firm value. The evidence suggests that financial
constraints do affect firm value and that the severity of constraints
varies over time. Second, our investigation of the role of financial
constraints in asset pricing reveals the surprising result that
constrained firms earn lower returns than unconstrained firms, a result
not explainable using existing asset-pricing models. Third, financially
constrained firms do not have returns that are significantly more
cyclical than average. Thus, the source of the common economic shocks to
financially constrained firms remains an open question.The proxies are
constructed based on Kaplan and Zingales (1995)''

Elgers, Lo, and Pfeiffer Jr (2001): ``The paper documents that the
weighthing of analysts annual earnings forecasts implicit in security
prices is lower than the historical relation between the financial
analysts forecasts and realized earnings. Our evidence that analysts the
beginging of the year annual earnings forecasts are associated with
abnormal security returns subsequently accumulated over the earnings
year is consistent with the delayed price reaction to the value-relevant
information in the posistions in the securityies in the bottom (top)
deciles of the corss-sectional distribution of the analysts earnings
forecasts early in the earnings year, generates statistically
siginificant trading profits in the year after porfolio formation for
firms with relatively low analysts coverage.''

P. A. Gompers and Metrick (2001): ``We analyze the investors preferences
for the stock and the implications that these preferences have for
stock-market prices and returns. We find that large institutional
investors- a category including all managers with greater than \$100
million under discretional control --have nearly doubled their share of
the common staock from 1980 to 1996, with most of this increase driven
by the growth in the holdings of the largest one hundred institutions.''

Griffin and Lemmon (2002): ``This paper examines the relationship
between book-to-market equity, distress risk, and stock returns. Among
firms with the highest distress risk as proxied by Ohlson (1980)
0-score, the difference in returns between high and low book-tomarket
securities is more than twice as large as that in other firms. This
large return differential cannot be explained by the three-factor model
or by differences in economic fundamentals. Consistent with mispricing
arguments, firms with high distress risk exhibit the largest return
reversals around earnings announcements, and the book-to-market effect
is largest in small firms with low analyst coverage.''

Diether, Malloy, and Scherbina (2002): ``We provide evidence that stocks
with higher dispersion in analysts' earnings fore-casts earn lower
future returns than otherwise similar stocks. This effect is
mostpronounced in small stocks and stocks that have performed poorly
over the pastyear. Interpreting dispersion in analysts' forecasts as a
proxy for differences inopinion about a stock, we show that this
evidence is consistent with the hypothesisthat prices will reflect the
optimistic view whenever investors with the lowestvaluations do not
trade. By contrast, our evidence is inconsistent with a view
thatdispersion in analysts' forecasts proxies for risk.''

J. Chen, Hong, and Stein (2002): '' In this paper, we bring new evidence
to bear on an asset-pricing hypothesis which has been around for a long
while, but which has thus far not recieved much empirical support. The
idea, which dates back to Miller, has to do with the combined effects of
short-sales constraints and differences of opinion on stock prices. We
develop a model of stock prices in which there are both differences of
opinion among investors as well as short-sales constraints. The key
insights that emerge in that breadth of ownerwhip is a valuation
indicator. When the breadth is low- when investors have long positions
in the stock- this signals that hte short-sales constrarint in binding
tightly, implying that prices are high relative to fundamentls and that
expected reutrns are therefore low.''

P. Gompers, Ishii, and Metrick (2003): ``Shareholder rights vary across
firms. Using the incidence of 24 governance rules, we construct a
``Governance Index'' to proxy for the level of shareholder rights at
about 1500 large firms during the 1990s. An investment strategy that
bought firms in the lowest decile of the index (strongest rights) and
sold firms in the highest decile of the index (weakest rights) would
have earned abnormal returns of 8.5 percent per year during the sample
period. We find that firms with stronger shareholder rights had higher
firm value, higher profits, higher sales growth, lower capital
expenditures, and made fewer corporate acquisitions.''

Doyle, Lundholm, and Soliman (2003): ``We investigate the informational
properties of pro forma earnings. This increasingly popular measure of
earnings excludes certain expenses that the company deems non-recurring,
non-cash, or otherwise unimportant for understanding the future value of
the firm. We find, however, that these expenses are far from
unimportant. Higher levels of exclusions lead to predictably lower
future cash flows. We also find that investors do not fully appreciate
the lower cash flow implications at the time of the earnings
announcement. A trading strategy based on the excluded expenses yields a
large positive abnormal return in the years following the announcement,
and persists after controlling for various risk factors and other
anomalies.''

Doyle, Lundholm, and Soliman (2003):

Watkins (2003): ``I analyze the degree to which return consistency in
the past predicts future returns. It is discovered here that consistency
is a strong predictive measure for future stock returns. In a portfolio
context, positively consistent stocks exhibit positive future
risk-adjusted returns, and negatively consistent stocks exhibit negative
future risk-adjusted returns. The results are economically and
statistically significant over multiple sub-periods. Also, odd return
behavior persists for nearly two years after portfolio formation. Stocks
that have been consistently positive (negative) for longer time horizons
have higher(lower) risk-adjusted returns during the following month than
those which have been consistent for shorter time periods. Finally, it
is determined that high consistency enhances momentum when the two
factors are allowed to interact. Thus, there appears to be strong path
dependence in the momentum effect, and consistency in stock returns
appears to be an important component of return predictability.''

Eberhart, Maxwell, and Siddique (2004): ``We examine a sample of 8,313
cases, between 1951 and 2001, where firms unex edly increase their
research and development (R\&D) expenditures by a signif amount. We find
consistent evidence of a misreaction, as manifested in the si cantly
positive abnormal stock returns that our sample firms' shareholders expe
following these increases. We also find consistent evidence that our
sample firm perience significantly positive long-term abnormal operating
performance follow their R\&D increases. Our findings suggest that R\&D
increases are beneficial in ments, and that the market is slow to
recognize the extent of this benefit (cons with investor
underreaction).'' George and Hwang (2004): ``When coupled with a stock's
current price, a readily available piece of information 52-week high
price-explains a large portion of the profits from momentum investi
Nearness to the 52-week high dominates and improves upon the forecasting
power past returns (both individual and industry returns) for future
returns. Future retu forecast using the 52-week high do not reverse in
the long run. These results indi that short-term momentum and long-term
reversals are largely separate phenome which presents a challenge to
current theory that models these aspects of secur returns as integrated
components of the market's resp''
