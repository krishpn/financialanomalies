# Introduction

@fama1973risk show two-parameter regression model estimates average risk-return relationships based on efficient market porfolio ($m$), that is, the market prices fully reflect the available information. The asset are  constructed based on Equation \ref{Equation:BlackScholes1972} for an asset ($i$) proposed by @@black1972capital. 

```{=tex}
\begin{align}
    &x_{im}  \equiv \frac{\text{total market value of all units of assets} \ i}{\text{total market value of all assets}} \\
    &\text{where asset} (i) \text{in the portfolio} (m) \nonumber 
\end{align}
\label{Equation:BlackScholes1972}
```

Excepted return of a security ($i$) is $E(\tilde{R_0})$, the expected return on a security that is riskless in the portfolio $m$, plus a risk premium that is $\beta_i$ times the difference between expected return of the portfolio ($E(\tilde{R_m})$ ) and riskless portfolio ($E(\tilde{R_0})$). is calculated by Equation \ref{Equation:ExpectedReturnFama1953}, $\beta_i$ is the risk of the asset $i$ of the portfolio $m$, measured relative to $\sigma^{2}(\tilde{R}_m)$


```{=tex}
\begin{align}
    &E(\tilde{R_i}) = \left[E(\tilde{R_m}) -S_m \sum\tilde{R_m}  \right] + S_m \sigma (\tilde{R_m}) \beta_i, \nonumber \\
    &\text{where}, \nonumber \\ 
    &\beta_i \equiv \frac{cov(\tilde{R_i}, \tilde{R_m})}{\sigma^2(\tilde{R_m})} = \frac{\sigma_{j=1}^{N} x_{jm}\sigma_{ij}}{\sigma^2 (\tilde{R_m})}=\frac{cov(\tilde{R_i},\tilde{R_m})/\sigma(\tilde{R_m})}{\sigma (\tilde{R_m})} \nonumber \\
    &S_m=\frac{E(\tilde{R_m})-E(\tilde{R_0})}{\sigma (\tilde{R_m})}  \nonumber\\
    \text{hence} \nonumber \\
    &E(\tilde{R_i}) = E(\tilde{R_0}) + \left[ E(\tilde{R_m}) - E(\tilde{R_0}) \right] \beta_i
\end{align}
\label{Equation:ExpectedReturnFama1953}
```

For each period of $t$, the cross sectional regression is given by 

```{=tex}
\begin{align}
    & R_{pt} = \tilde{\gamma}_{0t} + \tilde{\gamma}_{1t} \tilde{\beta}_{p,t-1}+\tilde{\gamma}_{2t} \tilde{\beta}_{p,t-1}^{2} + \tilde{\gamma}_{3t} \bar{s}_{p, t-1} \tilde{\epsilon}_{i}+\tilde{\eta}_{pt}, \\
    &p=1,2,...t \nonumber
\end{align}
\label{Equation:ExpectedReturnFama1953EquationTen}
```

Equation \ref{Equation:ExpectedReturnFama1953EquationTen} the indepenent variable $\tilde{\beta}_{p,t-1}$ is the average of the $\tilde{\beta}_i$ for securities in portfolio $p$, $\tilde{\beta}_{p,t-1}^2$ is the average of the squared values of these $\tilde{\beta}_i$, $\bar{s}_{p, t-1} \tilde{\epsilon}_{i}$ is the average of $s\tilde{\epsilon}_i$ for portfolio $p_i$


@gupta1975investors examines investors growth expectations reflected in the stock prices. A change in the expectation is reflected in the price movement. The study defines the earnings price ratio is a function of risk characteristics of the security and the expected growth in the earnings in Equation \ref{Equation:OferEquation1975EquationOne}. The risk component are measured by:
- the beta coefficient
- the firm asset size
- dividend payout ratio
- leverage
- earnings variablity

```{=tex}
\begin{align}

&EP = f(RS, EG) \\
&\text{where:} \nonumber \\
& EP = \text{earnings price ratio- }, \nonumber \\
& RS = \text{risk characteristics of the security} \nonumber \\
& EG =\text{the expected growth rate in the earnings} \nonumber \\

\end{align}
\label{Equation:OferEquation1975EquationOne}
```


```{=tex}
\begin{align}
    & \Delta P_{i}^{t} = \frac{P_{it}-P_{it-1}}{P_{it-1}} \times 100 \\
    & \text{where } \Delta P_{i}^{t} \text{is the percent change of the security } i \text{during the period} t-1 \text{to} t \nonumber \\
    & \text{The average yearly percentage of the prices change for portfolio} j (\Delta P_j) \text{is given by}
    & \Delta P_{j} =\frac{\sum_{t=1}^{14} \frac{\sum_{r_t=10j-9}^{10j} \Delta P_{rt}^{t}}{14} }{14}, r_{t}=1,\cdots,190 \nonumber\\
    & \text{where:} \nonumber \\
    & r_{t} = \text{the relative ranking of a security at time t according to its prediction error at that year}. \\
    & \Delta P_{t}^{rt} = \text{percentage price change during the period} t-1 \text{to} t \text{for a security that has the rank of} r_t \text{at time} t
\end{align}
\label{Equation:OferEquation1975}
